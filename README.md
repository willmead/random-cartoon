Random Cartoon Player
===

This is a simple python3 script to grab a random cartoon from the website https://www.b98.tv/ and stream it.

To install, clone this repository then run the command

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

which should install the necessary modules. As this script uses vlc player to stream the cartoon that must be installed separately.

To run the script simply run the commands:

`cd random_cartoon`

`python3 med_grab.py`
